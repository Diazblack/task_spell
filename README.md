To start your Phoenix server:

# Installation 
  Follow the instructions to install Elixir 1.18.3-otp-27 [Elixir Lang Org Page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) 
  If you have a different version of Elixir installed, I recommend using asdf for version management. 
  For more information visit [asdf homepage](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
