To start your Phoenix server:

# Installation 
  Follow the instructions to install Elixir 1.18.3-otp-27 [Elixir Lang Org Page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) 
  If you have a different version of Elixir installed, I recommend using asdf for version management. 
  For more information visit [asdf homepage](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)

### Elixir/Phoenix
  Follow the [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html) installation guide to install all the required dependencies.

  * This application requires Elixir version 1.18.3-otp-27 [Elixir Lang Org Page](https://elixir-lang.org/install.html) and Erlang version 27.3.1
  * If you have a different version of Elixir and Erlang installed, I recommend using asdf for version management. For more information visit [asdf homepage](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)

### Postgres & DB Setup

1. You will need PostgreSQL running in you local machine. If you are in an IOS environment homebrew is onw of the easiest ways to install by `brew install postgresql`. [Here] is a wiki link with more information about how to install PostgreSQL

2. Follow the homebrew install advice on how to run the database manually when needed, or for convenience, you can run it automatically on boot by running `brew services start postgresql` once.

3. Create a `postgres` user for the database: `createuser -s postgres` if needed 

4. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`

5. Seed your database by running `Run `mix seed` to run the seed file `

6. Start Phoenix server byt running `mix phx.server` or if you prefer to start the server along side IEx run `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000/todo_lists) from your browser.
